# Neuroscience, Language, and Engineering

## ABOUT ME:

I believe in language as the unit of knowledge. 🈂️ <br>
I believe in the nervous system as the vehicle through which knowledge impacts reality. 🧠 <br>
I believe in the value and potential of studying, questioning, and sharing that knowledge for the common good. 🌎 <br>

#The Goal:
I aspire to participate in the increasingly close relationship between technology and the brain. I aim for new technological possibilities to be leveraged not only to enhance senses or distractions, but to generate new ways of acquiring, managing, and leveraging knowledge.
