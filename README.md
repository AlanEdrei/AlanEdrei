# Alan Edrei Flores Gaona - Neuroscience, Language, and Engineering

## ABOUT ME:

I believe in language as the unit of knowledge.  
I believe in the nervous system as the vehicle through which knowledge impacts reality.  
I believe in the value and potential of studying, questioning, and sharing that knowledge for the common good.
