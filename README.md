## ABOUT ME:

🈂️ I believe in language as the unit of knowledge.  <br>
🧠 I believe in the nervous system as the vehicle through which knowledge impacts reality.  <br>
🌎 I believe in the value and potential of studying, questioning, and sharing that knowledge for the common good.  <br>

## The Goal: <br>
I aspire to participate in the growing relationship between brain and technology. My goal will be to take advantage of new technological possibilities not only to enhance the senses or make distractions more attractive. On the contrary, I hope that the future will also provide new ways of acquiring, managing, and leveraging knowledge. Pleasure and comfort have a limit, human development and knowledge do not.
